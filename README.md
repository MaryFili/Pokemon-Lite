## Gameplay:

Players can choose from 5 different Pokemon to battle with:

After choosing their pokemon, players can choose between different actions:

There are 4 different skills that a pokemon could use to attack the other player. But not all the skills will be available for your pokemon.

The skills are:

The game ends when one of the player's pokemon is defeated. The remaining player will be declared the winner.

## Future Plans

There are several features that can be added to improve the game:

- Add more pokemon with different skills and stats
- Implement a healing system where players can restore their pokemon's health
- Add a level system where pokemon can level up and gain new skills or stats
- Create a graphical interface to make the game more visually appealing.

These are just a few ideas of what can be added to the game in the future. There are many other possibilities to explore and make the game more engaging and fun.
